    // The @ServerTimestamp tells Firestore that when it saves a task, and the created time is not filled, it should use the server timestamp in order to fill the timestamp. Because the client time (clock) can be out of sync, with the general worlds time or the backend time, and we need to make sure that all data is in sync, at uses the same clock
